# Production Readiness Execution Track

Derived from [production-readiness-checklist.md](./production-readiness-checklist.md).
Updated 2026-03-22 by audit swarm.

Source of truth remains `docs/production-readiness-checklist.md`.
This file is a working view for items that look implementation-ready and should be handled by cleanup, behavior, or UI/browser loops.

## Notes

- Batch 1 (T0 sweep) and Batch 2 (pixel-corner + pointer events) are mechanical and can be parallelized across agents.
- Do not pull in architecture questions from the mixed or research tracks mid-loop.
- When an execution item reveals a deeper contract or ownership question, move it back to the mixed track before continuing.
