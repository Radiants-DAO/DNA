# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

DNA (Design Nexus Architecture) is a theme system specification for AI-assisted development workflows. It provides a standardized token system, component schema format, and theme structure for portable design systems.

**Current Status:** Active development — Turborepo + pnpm monorepo.

### Monorepo Map

**Packages:**
- `@rdna/radiants` — Reference theme with ESLint plugin, icons, hooks (components in `components/core/`)
- `@rdna/preview` — Shared `PreviewPage` component for theme previews

**Apps:**
- `rad-os` — Next.js 16 desktop-OS UI with draggable window system (7 registered apps)

## Architecture

### Core Concepts

1. **Two-tier token system:**
   - Tier 1 (Brand): Raw palette values (`--color-sun-yellow`)
   - Tier 2 (Semantic): Purpose-based tokens that flip in color modes (`--color-page`)

2. **Component pattern** (two authored, one generated):
   - `Component.tsx` — Implementation
   - `Component.meta.ts` — Source of truth: props, slots, token bindings, registry config
   - `Component.schema.json` — Generated from meta (`pnpm registry:generate`)

3. **Headless primitives:** All interactive components wrap `@base-ui/react` (v1.3.0)

### Theme Package Structure

```
theme-{name}/
├── package.json           # Required
├── index.css              # CSS entry point
├── tokens.css             # Design tokens (@theme blocks)
├── typography.css         # Element styles (@layer base)
├── fonts.css              # @font-face declarations
├── dark.css               # Dark mode overrides
├── base.css               # Base reset/element styles
├── animations.css         # Motion tokens/keyframes
├── components/core/       # UI components
└── dna.config.json        # Optional metadata
```

### Required Semantic Tokens

All themes must define these minimum tokens:
- `--color-page`, `--color-inv`
- `--color-main`, `--color-flip`
- `--color-line`

## Key Decisions

| Area | Choice |
|------|--------|
| CSS | Tailwind v4 native (`@theme` blocks) |
| Token naming | Semantic: `surface-*`, `content-*`, `edge-*` |
| Components | Copy-on-import, not installed as dependencies |
| Color modes | Light + Dark only (v1) |
| Motion | CSS-first, ease-out only, max 300ms |
| Icons | Custom dual-size sets: 16px pixel-art + 24px detailed |

## Styling Rules

```tsx
// DO: Use semantic tokens
className="bg-page text-main border-line"

// DON'T: Hardcode colors
className="bg-[#FEF8E2] text-[#0F0E0C]"
```

## ESLint Plugin (`eslint-plugin-rdna`)

Custom ESLint plugin at `packages/radiants/eslint/`, imported as `@rdna/radiants/eslint`. Plain ESM (`.mjs`), no build step.

### Rules (core shipped)

| Rule | What it catches |
|------|----------------|
| `rdna/no-hardcoded-colors` | non-semantic color usage in classNames or style objects |
| `rdna/no-hardcoded-spacing` | Arbitrary bracket spacing (`p-[12px]`) |
| `rdna/no-hardcoded-typography` | Arbitrary font-size/weight in brackets |
| `rdna/prefer-rdna-components` | Raw `<button>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, `<dialog>`, etc. |
| `rdna/no-removed-aliases` | Banned tokens (`--color-black`, `--color-white`, etc.) |
| `rdna/no-raw-radius` | Arbitrary rounded classes or raw radius styles |
| `rdna/no-raw-shadow` | Arbitrary shadow classes or raw `boxShadow` styles |
| `rdna/no-clipped-shadow` | `shadow-*` tokens on pixel-cornered elements (use `pixel-shadow-*`) |
| `rdna/no-pixel-border` | `border-*` on pixel-cornered elements (use `::after` pseudo-border) |
| `rdna/no-hardcoded-motion` | Arbitrary duration/easing classes or raw motion styles |
| `rdna/no-raw-line-height` | Arbitrary line-height values in style props (use `var(--leading-*)`) |
| `rdna/no-raw-font-family` | Hardcoded font-family in style props |
| `rdna/no-pattern-color-override` | Hardcoded colors on pattern-mode elements |
| `rdna/no-arbitrary-icon-size` | Icon size not 16 or 24, or removed `iconSet` prop |

### Configs

| Config | Scope | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| `recommended` | `apps/rad-os/**` | 14 shared RDNA rules at `warn` |
| `internals` | `packages/radiants/components/core/**` | `prefer-rdna-components: off` |
| `recommended-strict` | Not yet activated | Shared rules at `error` (migration target) |

### Repo-local RDNA review rules (shipped in `eslint.rdna.config.mjs`)

- `rdna/no-viewport-breakpoints-in-window-layout`
- `rdna/require-exception-metadata`
- `rdna/no-broad-rdna-disables`
- `rdna/no-mixed-style-authority`

**Exception format**:
```tsx
// eslint-disable-next-line rdna/<rule> -- reason:<reason> owner:<team-slug> expires:YYYY-MM-DD issue:DNA-123
```

Only `eslint-disable-next-line` is allowed for `rdna/*` exceptions. `owner` must be a lowercase team slug, `issue` can also be a full `https://...` URL, and new exceptions are reported in CI.

**Governance:** shared rules still follow `warn` → fix baseline → flip to `error` → pre-commit → CI.

## User Communication Style

The user communicates tersely and rapidly. Interpret the following patterns:

### Abbreviations
| Short | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `w/` / `w/o` | with / without |
| `rn` | right now |
| `rq` | real quick |
| `wdyt` | what do you think? |
| `lmk` | let me know |
| `prev` | preview (deployment or Vercel preview) |
| `prod` | production |
| `bg` | background |
| `deps` | dependencies |
| `ye` | yeah / yes |
| `gg` | good game / well done |
| `impl` | implementation |
| `CTA` | call to action |
| `RDNA` | @rdna npm scope |

### Terse Commands
| Input | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `continue` | Proceed with current task / next step |
| `what's next?` | What should we work on next in the plan? |
| `do it` | Proceed with the proposed approach |
| `start work!` | Begin executing the current plan |
| `undo` | Revert the most recent change |
| `kill it` / `kill the [X]` | Remove / delete it |
| `scrap` | Delete and start over |
| `rebuild` / `rebuid` | Rebuild the extension/project |
| `deploy` / `push to prod` / `push to prev` | Deploy to production or Vercel preview |
| `spawn a team` | Create parallel agents for a task |
| `investigate` / `diagnose` | Debug the issue and report findings |
| `this session` | The changes from this conversation |
| `paralell` | Run tasks concurrently |

### Bare Values = CSS Adjustments
When the user sends just a number or CSS value (e.g., `80%`, `1.25`, `try 1.15`, `0.5 rem`),
apply that value to the property most recently discussed.

### Option Selection
`1a, 2b` or `1a 2d` = selecting choices from a numbered/lettered list.
A standalone letter like `B` = selecting that option.

### Feedback Signals
| Response | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `great` / `fantastic` / `wonderful` | Approved, continue |
| `yup` / `ye` / `that's fine` | Yes, proceed |
| `nope` / `nah` | No, that is wrong |
| `not quite` / `close but` | Direction is right, execution is off |
| `hm` | Skeptical, something seems off |
| `oop` | User made a mistake, self-correcting |
| `still [X]` | The fix did not work, problem persists |
| `sweet` / `whew` | Satisfied / that was significant |

### Known Spelling Patterns
These are consistent spellings, not typos to correct:
- `impliment` / `implimentation` / `implimented` = implement
- `posistion` / `posistioned` = position
- `neccisary` = necessary
- `paralell` = parallel
- `seperate` = separate
- `scaffhold` = scaffold
- `calender` = calendar
- `accessability` = accessibility
- `dissapear` = disappear
- `redepploy` = redeploy
- `andriod` = android

### Agent Preference
Prefer `spawn a team` (Task tool) over individual subagents. Use teams for parallel work — the user has tokens to use.

### Project Nicknames
| Shorthand | Refers To |
|-----------|-----------|
| `/radiants` | `packages/radiants/` |
| `/rad-os` | `apps/rad-os/` |

## Context Preservation Rules

When summarizing or compacting this conversation, always preserve:
- The current research objective
- The current leading architecture
- The scorecard criteria
- Unresolved open questions
- Artifact file paths under `docs/research/design-guard/`
- Rejected architectures and why they were rejected
- Migration constraints from the current repo

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**IMPORTANT: This project has a knowledge graph. ALWAYS use the
code-review-graph MCP tools BEFORE using Grep/Glob/Read to explore
the codebase.** The graph is faster, cheaper (fewer tokens), and gives
you structural context (callers, dependents, test coverage) that file
scanning cannot.

### When to use graph tools FIRST

- **Exploring code**: `semantic_search_nodes` or `query_graph` instead of Grep
- **Understanding impact**: `get_impact_radius` instead of manually tracing imports
- **Code review**: `detect_changes` + `get_review_context` instead of reading entire files
- **Finding relationships**: `query_graph` with callers_of/callees_of/imports_of/tests_for
- **Architecture questions**: `get_architecture_overview` + `list_communities`

Fall back to Grep/Glob/Read **only** when the graph doesn't cover what you need.

### Key Tools

| Tool | Use when |
|------|----------|
| `detect_changes` | Reviewing code changes — gives risk-scored analysis |
| `get_review_context` | Need source snippets for review — token-efficient |
| `get_impact_radius` | Understanding blast radius of a change |
| `get_affected_flows` | Finding which execution paths are impacted |
| `query_graph` | Tracing callers, callees, imports, tests, dependencies |
| `semantic_search_nodes` | Finding functions/classes by name or keyword |
| `get_architecture_overview` | Understanding high-level codebase structure |
| `refactor_tool` | Planning renames, finding dead code |

### Workflow

1. The graph auto-updates on file changes (via hooks).
2. Use `detect_changes` for code review.
3. Use `get_affected_flows` to understand impact.
4. Use `query_graph` pattern="tests_for" to check coverage.
